 *   - It is possible to pass in an initialValue for props
 *   - If a prop is missing from previous objects, the reducer will be called
 *     as if this prop were the first item, rather than with undefined

 * @param {function} reducer - receives the current prop value and next prop
 *                             value, returns the value to set to the prop
 * @param {*} [initialValue] - optional initial value for each prop
 * @returns {Object} the merged object
