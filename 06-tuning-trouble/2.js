// --- Part Two ---

// Your device's communication system is correctly detecting packets, but still
// isn't working. It looks like it also needs to look for messages.

// A start-of-message marker is just like a start-of-packet marker, except it
// consists of 14 distinct characters rather than 4.

// Here are the first positions of start-of-message markers for all of the above
// examples:

// - mjqjpqmgbljsphdztnvjfqwrcgsmlb: first marker after character 19
// - bvwbjplbgvbhsrlpgdmjqwftvncz: first marker after character 23
// - nppdvjthqldpwncqszvftbrmjlhg: first marker after character 23
// - nznrnfrfntjfmvfwmzdfjlvtqnbhcprsg: first marker after character 29
// - zcfzfwzzqfrljwzlrfnpqdbhtmscgvjw: first marker after character 26

// How many characters need to be processed before the first start-of-message
// marker is detected?
