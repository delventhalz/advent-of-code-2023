// --- Part Two ---

// For some reason, the sea port's computer system still can't communicate with
// your ferry's docking program. It must be using version 2 of the decoder
// chip!

// A version 2 decoder chip doesn't modify the values being written at all.
// Instead, it acts as a memory address decoder. Immediately before a value is
// written to memory, each bit in the bitmask modifies the corresponding bit of
// the destination memory address in the following way:

// - If the bitmask bit is 0, the corresponding memory address bit is
//   unchanged.
// - If the bitmask bit is 1, the corresponding memory address bit is
//   overwritten with 1.
// - If the bitmask bit is X, the corresponding memory address bit is floating.

// A floating bit is not connected to anything and instead fluctuates
// unpredictably. In practice, this means the floating bits will take on all
// possible values, potentially causing many memory addresses to be written all
// at once!

// For example, consider the following program:

//     mask = 000000000000000000000000000000X1001X
//     mem[42] = 100
//     mask = 00000000000000000000000000000000X0XX
//     mem[26] = 1

// When this program goes to write to memory address 42, it first applies the
// bitmask:

//     address: 000000000000000000000000000000101010  (decimal 42)
//     mask:    000000000000000000000000000000X1001X
//     result:  000000000000000000000000000000X1101X

// After applying the mask, four bits are overwritten, three of which are
// different, and two of which are floating. Floating bits take on every
// possible combination of values; with two floating bits, four actual memory
// addresses are written:

//     000000000000000000000000000000011010  (decimal 26)
//     000000000000000000000000000000011011  (decimal 27)
//     000000000000000000000000000000111010  (decimal 58)
//     000000000000000000000000000000111011  (decimal 59)

// Next, the program is about to write to memory address 26 with a different
// bitmask:

//     address: 000000000000000000000000000000011010  (decimal 26)
//     mask:    00000000000000000000000000000000X0XX
//     result:  00000000000000000000000000000001X0XX

// This results in an address with three floating bits, causing writes to eight
// memory addresses:

//     000000000000000000000000000000010000  (decimal 16)
//     000000000000000000000000000000010001  (decimal 17)
//     000000000000000000000000000000010010  (decimal 18)
//     000000000000000000000000000000010011  (decimal 19)
//     000000000000000000000000000000011000  (decimal 24)
//     000000000000000000000000000000011001  (decimal 25)
//     000000000000000000000000000000011010  (decimal 26)
//     000000000000000000000000000000011011  (decimal 27)

// The entire 36-bit address space still begins initialized to the value 0 at
// every address, and you still need the sum of all values left in memory at
// the end of the program. In this example, the sum is 208.

// Execute the initialization program using an emulator for a version 2 decoder
// chip. What is the sum of all values left in memory after it completes?
