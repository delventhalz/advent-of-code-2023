// --- Part Two ---

// The shuttle company is running a contest: one gold coin for anyone that can
// find the earliest timestamp such that the first bus ID departs at that time
// and each subsequent listed bus ID departs at that subsequent minute. (The
// first line in your input is no longer relevant.)

// For example, suppose you have the same list of bus IDs as above:

//     7,13,x,x,59,x,31,19

// An x in the schedule means there are no constraints on what bus IDs must
// depart at that time.

// This means you are looking for the earliest timestamp (called t) such that:

// - Bus ID 7 departs at timestamp t.
// - Bus ID 13 departs one minute after timestamp t.
// - There are no requirements or restrictions on departures at two or three
//   minutes after timestamp t.
// - Bus ID 59 departs four minutes after timestamp t.
// - There are no requirements or restrictions on departures at five minutes
//   after timestamp t.
// - Bus ID 31 departs six minutes after timestamp t.
// - Bus ID 19 departs seven minutes after timestamp t.

// The only bus departures that matter are the listed bus IDs at their specific
// offsets from t. Those bus IDs can depart at other times, and other bus IDs
// can depart at those times. For example, in the list above, because bus ID 19
// must depart seven minutes after the timestamp at which bus ID 7 departs, bus
// ID 7 will always also be departing with bus ID 19 at seven minutes after
// timestamp t.

// In this example, the earliest timestamp at which this occurs is 1068781:

// In the above example, bus ID 7 departs at timestamp 1068788 (seven minutes
// after t). This is fine; the only requirement on that minute is that bus ID
// 19 departs then, and it does.

// Here are some other examples:

// - The earliest timestamp that matches the list 17,x,13,19 is 3417.
// - 67,7,59,61 first occurs at timestamp 754018.
// - 67,x,7,59,61 first occurs at timestamp 779210.
// - 67,7,x,59,61 first occurs at timestamp 1261476.
// - 1789,37,47,1889 first occurs at timestamp 1202161486.

// However, with so many bus IDs in your list, surely the actual earliest
// timestamp will be larger than 100000000000000!

// What is the earliest timestamp such that all of the listed bus IDs depart at
// offsets matching their positions in the list?
