// --- Part Two ---

// As you finish identifying the misplaced items, the Elves come to you with
// another issue.

// For safety, the Elves are divided into groups of three. Every Elf carries a
// badge that identifies their group. For efficiency, within each group of
// three Elves, the badge is the only item type carried by all three Elves.
// That is, if a group's badge is item type B, then all three Elves will have
// item type B somewhere in their rucksack, and at most two of the Elves will
// be carrying any other item type.

// The problem is that someone forgot to put this year's updated authenticity
// sticker on the badges. All of the badges need to be pulled out of the
// rucksacks so the new authenticity stickers can be attached.

// Additionally, nobody wrote down which item type corresponds to each group's
// badges. The only way to tell which item type is the right one is by finding
// the one item type that is common between all three Elves in each group.

// Every set of three lines in your list corresponds to a single group, but each
// group can have a different badge item type. So, in the above example, the
// first group's rucksacks are the first three lines:

//     vJrwpWtwJgWrhcsFMMfFFhFp
//     jqHRNqRjqzjGDLGLrsFMfFZSrLrFZsSL
//     PmmdzqPrVvPwwTWBwg

// And the second group's rucksacks are the next three lines:

//     wMqvLMZHhHMvwLHjbvcjnnSBnvTQFn
//     ttgJtRGJQctTZtZT
//     CrZsJsPPZsGzwwsLwLmpwMDw

// In the first group, the only item type that appears in all three rucksacks is
// lowercase r; this must be their badges. In the second group, their badge
// item type must be Z.

// Priorities for these items must still be found to organize the sticker
// attachment efforts: here, they are 18 (r) for the first group and 52 (Z) for
// the second group. The sum of these is 70.

// Find the item type that corresponds to the badges of each three-Elf group.
// What is the sum of the priorities of those item types?

const findBadge = ([first, second, third]) => {
  return third.split('').find(c => first.includes(c) && second.includes(c));

const scoreBadge = (badge) => {
  const code = badge.charCodeAt(0)

  if (code < 91) {
    return code - 38;
  }
