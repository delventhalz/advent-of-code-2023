// --- Part Two ---

// By the time you calculate the answer to the Elves' question, they've already
// realized that the Elf carrying the most Calories of food might eventually
// run out of snacks.

// To avoid this unacceptable situation, the Elves would instead like to know
// the total Calories carried by the top three Elves carrying the most
// Calories. That way, even if one of those Elves runs out of snacks, they
// still have two backups.

// In the example above, the top three Elves are the fourth Elf (with 24000
// Calories), then the third Elf (with 11000 Calories), then the fifth Elf
// (with 10000 Calories). The sum of the Calories carried by these three elves
// is 45000.

// Find the top three Elves carrying the most Calories. How many Calories are
// those Elves carrying in total?

const { sum } = require('../lib');


module.exports = (inputs) => {
  const calorieCounts = inputs.map(sum).sort((a, b) => b - a);
  return sum(calorieCounts.slice(0, 3));
};

// Your puzzle answer was 197291.
