// --- Part Two ---

// You lost to the small crab! Fortunately, crabs aren't very good at
// recursion. To defend your honor as a Raft Captain, you challenge the small
// crab to a game of Recursive Combat.

// Recursive Combat still starts by splitting the cards into two decks (you
// offer to play with the same starting decks as before - it's only fair).
// Then, the game consists of a series of rounds with a few changes:

// - Before either player deals a card, if there was a previous round in this
//   game that had exactly the same cards in the same order in the same
//   players' decks, the game instantly ends in a win for player 1. Previous
//   rounds from other games are not considered. (This prevents infinite games
//   of Recursive Combat, which everyone agrees is a bad idea.)
// - Otherwise, this round's cards must be in a new configuration; the players
//   begin the round by each drawing the top card of their deck as normal.
// - If both players have at least as many cards remaining in their deck as the
//   value of the card they just drew, the winner of the round is determined by
//   playing a new game of Recursive Combat (see below).
// - Otherwise, at least one player must not have enough cards left in their
//   deck to recurse; the winner of the round is the player with the
//   higher-value card.

// As in regular Combat, the winner of the round (even if they won the round by
// winning a sub-game) takes the two cards dealt at the beginning of the round
// and places them on the bottom of their own deck (again so that the winner's
// card is above the other card). Note that the winner's card might be the
// lower-valued of the two cards if they won the round due to winning a
// sub-game. If collecting cards by winning the round causes a player to have
// all of the cards, they win, and the game ends.

// Here is an example of a small game that would loop forever without the
// infinite game prevention rule:

//     Player 1:
//     43
//     19

//     Player 2:
//     2
//     29
//     14

// During a round of Recursive Combat, if both players have at least as many
// cards in their own decks as the number on the card they just dealt, the
// winner of the round is determined by recursing into a sub-game of Recursive
// Combat. (For example, if player 1 draws the 3 card, and player 2 draws the 7
// card, this would occur if player 1 has at least 3 cards left and player 2
// has at least 7 cards left, not counting the 3 and 7 cards that were drawn.)

// To play a sub-game of Recursive Combat, each player creates a new deck by
// making a copy of the next cards in their deck (the quantity of cards copied
// is equal to the number on the card they drew to trigger the sub-game).
// During this sub-game, the game that triggered it is on hold and completely
// unaffected; no cards are removed from players' decks to form the sub-game.
// (For example, if player 1 drew the 3 card, their deck in the sub-game would
// be copies of the next three cards in their deck.)

// Here is a complete example of gameplay, where Game 1 is the primary game of
// Recursive Combat:
